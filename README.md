# ðŸ¤– Telegram Anonymous Chat Bot

Welcome to the _Telegram Anonymous Chat Bot_ project! This bot is designed for users who value privacy and want to communicate with their contacts on Telegram, without revealing their identity. 

## ðŸŽ¯ Main Features

The main features of the Telegram Anonymous Chat Bot include:

1. **Message Anonymously**: Message anyone on Telegram, keeping your identity hidden. Just use their Telegram ID, like `@MyContact`, or forward one of their messages to our bot.
  
2. **Share Anonymous Link**: Generate an anonymous link, and share it anywhere on the Web. Anyone then can use this link to message you on Telegram while keeping their identity a secret. 

3. **Supports Multimedia**: Send not just text, but also photos, GIFs, documents, voice messages, audio, stickers, and videos - all anonymously!

4. **Reply to Messages**: Got an anonymous message? Reply to it directly and carry on the conversation, still not knowing who you're talking to.

5. **Block Users**: Too many messages from a particular user? Just use our block feature to stop receiving messages from them.

   
## ðŸ‘¥ Usage

To use the Telegram Anonymous Chat Bot, follow these steps:

1. **Start Bot**: On Telegram, search for '@YourBotName'. Click on Start or send "/start" to activate the bot.

2. **Send Anonymous Message**: You can now send an anonymous message. Use the format '@USERID YOUR MESSAGE". If you want to send an anonymous message to user @JohnDoe, type '@JohnDoe Hi! This is an anonymous message!" 

3. **Share Anonymous Link**: If you want others to send you anonymous messages, share the generated link with them.

4. **Respond to Anonymous Message**: If you receive an anonymous message, respond directly from the chat which will keep the chat sequence.

5. **Block A User**: To block a user from sending you anonymous messages, simply find one of their messages and select 'Block'.
